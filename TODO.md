## TODO

Are you an open source shell script developer? Please help us make this even more perfect.

Here is our current wish list:

- Instead of outputting `1` or `0` for backup success and fail, use a word such as SUCCESS or FAIL
- Make Slack do something special when it fails, e.g. present the output in the colour red, or play a sound
- Keeping track of backup times is super NB. It would be great that when the verb is read as "begin" (case insensitive) that a timer is created, which is read again afterwards if "end" is encountered

## DONE

~~ Update the readme with a screenshot that shows the Virtualmin UI and where these commands are inputted~~
